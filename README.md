| [Bank Turnover Dataset](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Bank-Turnover-Dataset) | Predict whether the bank client will close their bank account in the near future based on historical customer behavioral data.The developed model showed 84% accuracy of whether the customer will close an account within the next 6 months | Pandas , NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [Determining the cost of vehicles](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Determining-the-cost-of-vehicles) | A used car dealership is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Historical data is available: technical characteristics, configurations and prices of vehicles. We need to build a model to determine the cost. |Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost|
| [Predict Taxi Orders](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Predict-Taxi-Orders) | Taxi has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. In order to attract more drivers during the peak period, we need to predict the number of taxi calls in the next hour. Let's build a model for such a forecast. | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost |
