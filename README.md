| [Telecom](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/blob/main/Final%20Project/Telecom_final.ipynb) | Telecom operator wants to learn how to predict the outflow of customers. If it turns out that the user intends to leave him, promotional codes and special conditions will be offered.  | Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, LightGBM |
| [Determining the cost of vehicles](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Determining-the-cost-of-vehicles) | A used car dealership is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Historical data is available: technical characteristics, configurations and prices of vehicles. We need to build a model to determine the cost. |Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost|
| [Predict Taxi Orders](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Predict-Taxi-Orders) | Taxi has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. In order to attract more drivers during the peak period, we need to predict the number of taxi calls in the next hour. Let's build a model for such a forecast. | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost |
[Well site selection](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/blob/main/Well%20site%20selection/ML_in_buisness_ENG.ipynb) | Determine for the oil company where it is necessary to drill a new well that will bring the greatest profit on oil samples in three regions.| Pandas , NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
