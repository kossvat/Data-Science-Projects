| [Bank Turnover Dataset](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Bank-Turnover-Dataset) | Customers began to leave the Bank every month. A little, but noticeable. Bank marketers decided that it was cheaper to retain existing customers than to attract new ones. We need to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. We are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank. | Pandas , NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| [Determining the cost of vehicles](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Determining-the-cost-of-vehicles) | A used car dealership is developing an app to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. Historical data is available: technical characteristics, configurations and prices of vehicles. We need to build a model to determine the cost. |Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost|
| [Predict Taxi Orders](https://github.com/kossvat/Study-Projects/tree/main/Predict-Taxi-Orders) | Taxi has collected historical data on taxi bookings at airports. In order to attract more drivers during the peak period, we need to predict the number of taxi calls in the next hour. Let's build a model for such a forecast. | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost |
