# Determining the age of buyers
A chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
- Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
- Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.

Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photo. At our disposal is a set of photographs of people with age indication.
